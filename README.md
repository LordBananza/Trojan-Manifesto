# Trojan-Manifesto
A manifesto/constitution of the ways of my patrol, the Trojans.
Very few remain who remember the days of the DLC, of the First Trojan Patrol. It’s possible that I’m the final youth who witnessed such greatness. I will not let the lessons learned be forgotten as I move on into the realm of Youth+. In this manifesto, you will discover the answers to the ancient questions all Trojans must face, including: 
“How okay should I be?” 
“Why can’t we be better?”
“Does this patrol use a communist system of government?”
Use this knowledge well. Maintain the Trojans’ mediocrity, as the First Trojans once did. Should this patrol fall like before, keep the knowledge you learned from here as you continue through Scouting.
